I am using java spring batch to read data from large files and save it in a database. Is there any way to read the whole files in a directory, not just one file

Answer
Yes, you can use the MultiResourceItemReader in Java Spring Batch to read all files in a directory. The MultiResourceItemReader can be used to read in both files by using wildcards. You can configure the MultiResourceItemReader 
to read all csv files inside a specific folder sequentially. Here is an example of how to configure and use MultiResourceItemReader in a Spring Batch job:
@Bean
public MultiResourceItemReader multiResourceReader() {
    return new MultiResourceItemReaderBuilder<Foo>()
            .delegate(flatFileItemReader())
            .resources(resources())
            .build();
}


The resources() method should return an array of Resource objects that represent the files to be read. 
You can use a FileSystemResource to specify a directory and a wildcard to match all files in that directory. Here is an example:
@Bean
public Resource[] resources() {
    ResourcePatternResolver resolver = new PathMatchingResourcePatternResolver();
    Resource[] resources = resolver.getResources("file:/path/to/directory/*.csv");
    return resources;
}

This will match all files with the .csv extension in the /path/to/directory directory. You can then use the multiResourceReader() method as the ItemReader for your step.
